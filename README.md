# Product-store
This repository contains a full-stack Product Store application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). The application was built following the guidence provided by the youtuber `As a Programmer`. This project is the first of 4 projects provided in this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDZC8VDZnV8&t=8224s.

Thank you for reviewing this repo!


The deployed app can be viewed from https://product-store-ska2.onrender.com. 
Keep in mind that there is no security or authorization on this app, which makes it possible for everyone using the link to delete, update, and create new products in the product store.
I used Render's free version, so the requests might be delayed.
